## Objective
To better understand how people in Toronto are using Bike Share
To highlight some usage patterns for potential and exsiting users (e.g. popular routes, rush hours, avg speed, etc.)
To generate insights for maintenance and management (e.g. allocating bikes, identify broken bikes & stations, etc.) - still working on it!

A station is the strip of bikes that are available around the city, placed based on population and transport needs.
